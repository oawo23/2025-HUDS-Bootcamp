        "Sexually transmitted diseases remain a persistent public health concern across Texas and disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and they play a key role in shaping health outcomes. Factors such as poverty, education level, health insurance coverage, language barriers, and employment influence an individual's ability to access prevention, testing, and treatment services. Counties with lower socioeconomic status or higher rates of uninsured populations may experience higher rates of STD transmission.\n",
